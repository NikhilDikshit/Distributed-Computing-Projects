## Instructions on how the programs should work:

Make 2 files. Name one of them 'MyServer' and the other 'MyClient'. 

* **Run MyServer:** The program is waiting for the client. After the client is connected the server program sends *Hello !!*
* **Run MyClient:** This program receives the word: *Hello !!*  

The following steps are repeated until the client enters: *Bye*
```
$ Enter a message on the client’s console (Like: How are you server?) 
This message should appear on the server’s console (like: How are you server?)

$ Enter a message on the server’s console (like: I am good. Do you have any question client?) 
This message should appear on the client’s console (like: I am good. Do you have any question client?)
```
It is acceptable if both sides alternate on sending messages. However, it would be good if you make your project like the real online chat (e.g. yahoo messenger, skype messenger).
