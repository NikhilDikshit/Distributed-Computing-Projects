## Running Instructions for Project 3: 

* Run the server. Please note, nothing prompts right now but the server will start.
* Run the client. Enter the desired value of (size) constant identifier, eg 2 or 2500; it's the number of clients you want your server to work for. 
* N, *the aforementioned 'size'*, random values of Pi will be generated on the client's console.
* Go to the server’s console and enter the same constant identifier's value entered previously to take the average of all the recorded Pi values from the client.
* Socket closes and the server will be terminated.
* Go to the client’s console to see the average value of random Pi’s which has been responded by the server.
