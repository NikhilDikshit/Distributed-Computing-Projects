## Week 1 (09/23)
There are two arrays: 'a' and 'b' of type integer. Make two threads to sort: a and b. Make a third thread to merge these two arrays into array: c. The method: main should display array c. Note that the two sort threads should work concurrently. Once the array a and b are sorted the merge thread merges them.
